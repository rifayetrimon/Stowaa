# FastAPI E-Commerce Project

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to develop a scalable, high-performance, and secure e-commerce application using FastAPI. This application will enable users to browse, search, and purchase products while offering robust features for both users and administrators.

## Features

### User Features:
- User registration and authentication (JWT-based)
- Profile management
- Browse and search products with filters (e.g., price range, brand, category)
- Manage shopping cart and wishlist
- Checkout process with order tracking
- Product reviews and ratings
- Receive notifications for order updates and offers

### Admin Features:
- Manage products (CRUD operations)
- Manage categories
- User management (e.g., deactivate accounts)
- Manage orders (e.g., update status)
- View analytics (e.g., sales, user activity)

## Project Description

This e-commerce application is built on **FastAPI**, leveraging its modern, fast, and asynchronous capabilities. It uses PostgreSQL for relational data management, Redis for caching, and Elasticsearch for advanced product search. The application follows a modular and scalable architecture, making it easy to maintain and extend with new features.

### Tech Stack:
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Testing**: Pytest

### Project Structure:
The application is organized into well-defined modules, including models, schemas, API routes, services, and utilities. This structure ensures clean code and a separation of concerns, making it easier to scale and maintain.

### Deployment:
The project is containerized using Docker and can be deployed on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP. Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines can be configured using GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
